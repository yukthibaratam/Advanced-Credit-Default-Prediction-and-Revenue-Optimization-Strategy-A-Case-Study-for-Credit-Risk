# Advanced-Credit-Default-Prediction-and-Revenue-Optimization-Strategy-A-Case-Study-for-Credit-Risk

Developed an XGBoost model on the American Express Credit Default dataset to predict credit defaults, achieving an average AUC value of 98.42%. Implemented a strategic approach to optimize revenue while managing default risks through comprehensive data processing and hyperparameter tuning. Conducted bias/variance and SHAP analysis for model interpretability and compared various advanced modeling techniques, including neural networks and ensemble models, to ensure optimal performance.
